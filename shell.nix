  # Both stylish-haskell and Haskell-language-server are pulled in with niv
  # directly from their repositories at specific commits because the versions we
  # want are not yet in Hackage. Right now we are using stylish-haskell at
  # version 0.12.2.0 with some features that are not yet released in hackage,
  # and hls at version 1.1.0 which is also not released in hackage. Once one of
  # those arrives we can pull it in specifying a version on the tools attribute
  # set, something like:
  #
  # > tools = {
  # >   ...
  # >   haskell-language-server = "1.2.0.0";
  # >   stylish-haskell = "0.12.3.0";
  #
  # Note that the tools attribute comes from haskell-nix when defining the
  # shellFor function. At the same time, the niv depencency will not be needed
  # and it can be removed with `niv drop hls-released` or `niv drop
  # stylish-haskell` (or manually removing the relevant entries from
  # `sources.json`).
